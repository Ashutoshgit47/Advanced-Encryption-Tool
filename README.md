# 🔐 Advanced Encryption Tool - CODTECH Internship Task

A secure, user-friendly Python GUI application for encrypting and decrypting files using **AES encryption (CBC mode)** with password-based key derivation. This tool ensures your files are safely encrypted with a modern cryptographic approach and offers an intuitive interface built with Tkinter.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ AES-256 encryption in CBC mode  
- ✅ Password-based key derivation using PBKDF2  
- ✅ Simple, clean GUI using Tkinter  
- ✅ Secure IV handling (stored in encrypted file)  
- ✅ File padding/unpadding for block-aligned encryption  
- ✅ Works offline – no internet connection needed  
- ✅ No file size limit (text, images, PDFs, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How to Run


📦 Requirements

✅ Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.

Install the required Python package using:

```bash
python encryption_tool.py
pip install pycryptodome
cd advanced-encryption-tool
```

## 🖥️ GUI Usage

Browse to select the file you want to encrypt/decrypt.

Enter a password (used to derive the encryption key).

Click "Encrypt File" or "Decrypt File".

Output files will be saved as:

🔒 Encrypted: filename.ext.enc

🔓 Decrypted: filename.ext.dec

---
## 🔐 How It Works
AES-256 (CBC Mode): Used for actual file encryption.

PBKDF2: Derives a secure key from your password and a fixed salt.

IV (Initialization Vector): Randomly generated for each file and prepended to the ciphertext.

Padding: PKCS-style padding ensures file size aligns to AES block size.

---
## 📁 Example


Original file: notes.txt

After encryption: notes.txt.enc

After decryption: notes.txt.dec

---
## ⚠️ Security Notice


🔐 This tool uses a fixed salt for simplicity.
For production use, generate a random salt per session.

❗ If you forget your password, encrypted files cannot be recovered.

🚫 Never transmit passwords or encrypted files over unsecured channels.
